# Ten million years(10^7 years)later, the highest mass O star have used up all of their Hydrogenand begin to evolve off main sequence.

# After 100 billion years(10^8, all the O-stars gone into supernova.) B star begin to evolve off the main sequence.

# # Color magnitude diagram 

# Observers can't directly measure luminosities and absolute temperature. Instead we quantify the color and magnitude. Magnitude is related to luminosity and color is related to temperature.
